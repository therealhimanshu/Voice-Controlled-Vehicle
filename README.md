# simple-iot-projects
If you are in a need of any simple program for microcontrollers like Arduino  or NodeMCU, you can always visit this repository to get the programs. I will continue updating with new programs from time to time, so one day all of you can get all those programs here without worry.

Go from main branch to nodeMCU to view projects.
